    Remove projects from your local filesystem.

    The remove command provides an easy interface for decluttering your local
    projects directory.

    You can selectively remove any number of projects by passing them as
    arguments or nuke the whole lot with "--all/-a" if you want.

    As with most programmatic deleting, the directories are deleted instantly and
    not sent to trash. As such, pytoil will prompt you for confirmation before
    doing anything.

    The "--force/-f" flag can be used to force deletion without the confirmation
    prompt. Use with caution!

    Examples:

    $ pytoil remove project1 project2 project3

    $ pytoil remove project1 project2 project3 --force

    $ pytoil remove --all

    $ pytoil remove --all --force
