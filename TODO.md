# TODO

Below are a list of enhancements or things to fix based on my initial usage after installing locally:

* [ ] If no config file, pytoil config show raises an ugly error
* [ ] Tests for above
* [x] Config updated successfully message after pytoil config set should have exclamation mark (fixed)
* [x] After saying project is available locally in checkout, should be a newline before saying vscode opening
* [ ] Calling set python path on workspace settings.json raises ugly error if the file doesn't exist yet
* [ ] Tests for above
