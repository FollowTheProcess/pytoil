# Info

Another easy one! `info` simply shows you some summary information about whatever project you tell it to.

<div class="termy">

```console
// Let's get some info about pytoil
$ pytoil info pytoil

Info for pytoil:

           Key   Value
 â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

What happens here is pytoil uses the GitHub personal access token we talked about in [config] and hits the GitHub API to find out some basic information about the repo you pass to it :white_check_mark:

pytoil will always prefer this way of doing it as we can get things like license information and description which is a bit more helpful to show. If however, the project you're asking for information about does not exist on GitHub yet, you'll still get some info back!

<div class="termy">

```console
// Some project that's not on GitHub yet
$ pytoil info my_local_project

Info for testy:

       Key   Value

!!! note

    pytoil grabs this data from your operating system by using the `Path.stat()` method from [pathlib] :computer:

[config]: ../config.md
